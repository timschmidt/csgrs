# Examples

Minimal example of each function of csgrs.

Here, we do not use any shared data, so we'll bind the generic S to ().

# Scenes

Additional “SCENES” Demonstrating Each Function Minimally, these start with a capital letter

In these scenes, we typically:
1) Create the shape
2) Extrude (if 2D) so we can save an STL
3) Optionally union with a small arrow that points to a location of interest in the shape
4) Save the result as an STL, e.g. "scene_XX_something.stl"

Because many shapes are already in the main examples, these scenes are just short examples to help with explanation.
