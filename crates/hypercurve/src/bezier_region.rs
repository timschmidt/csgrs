//! Concrete retained regions bounded by Bezier and conic fragments.
//!
//! This module is the first higher-order region materializer: it consumes a
//! decided retained arrangement traversal and emits closed loops of native
//! polynomial Bezier and rational quadratic conic fragments. It deliberately
//! does not flatten these boundaries to line strings or force them into
//! [`Region2`](crate::Region2), because Yap's exact geometric-computation
//! model requires the exact curve objects to remain visible until a certified
//! adapter exists; see Yap, "Towards Exact Geometric Computation,"
//! *Computational Geometry* 7(1-2), 3-23 (1997).
//!
//! Exact area is currently exposed for polynomial Bezier loops using
//! Green's-theorem boundary integrals, the same identities used by
//! [`crate::BezierAreaMoments2`]. That follows Farin's Bernstein polynomial
//! identities in *Curves and Surfaces for CAGD* (5th ed., 2002). Rational conic
//! loops are still concrete boundary loops, but their area returns `None`
//! until rational integral support is added rather than silently sampling.
