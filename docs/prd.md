## IndexedMesh Module - High-Performance 3D Geometry Processing

### **Executive Summary**
IndexedMesh provides an optimized mesh representation for 3D geometry processing in CSGRS, leveraging indexed connectivity for superior memory efficiency and performance compared to the regular Mesh module while maintaining complete API compatibility.

### **Product Vision**
Create a drop-in replacement for the regular Mesh module that delivers:
- **50% memory reduction** through vertex deduplication
- **2-3x performance improvement** in CSG operations
- **100% API compatibility** with existing Mesh interface
- **Zero breaking changes** for existing users

### **Core Requirements**

#### **Functional Requirements**
1. **Complete Shape Generation API**
   - All primitive shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, torus, etc.)
   - Advanced shapes (TPMS, metaballs, SDF-based)
   - Parametric shapes (gears, airfoils, etc.)

2. **CSG Boolean Operations**
   - Union, difference, intersection, XOR
   - Direct indexed BSP operations (no conversion)
   - Manifold preservation guarantees

3. **Mesh Processing Operations**
   - Triangulation, subdivision, smoothing
   - Slicing, flattening, convex hull
   - Quality analysis and validation

4. **Import/Export Capabilities**
   - STL (ASCII/Binary), OBJ, PLY formats
   - Bevy Mesh, Parry TriMesh integration
   - GPU buffer generation

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Performance**
   - Memory usage â‰¤50% of regular Mesh
   - CSG operations 2-3x faster
   - Zero-copy operations where possible

2. **Reliability**
   - 100% test coverage for critical paths
   - Comprehensive edge case handling
   - Robust error recovery

3. **Maintainability**
   - SOLID design principles
   - Zero-cost abstractions
   - Iterator-based operations

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Complete API parity with regular Mesh
- [ ] All tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Memory usage validation confirms efficiency gains
- [ ] Production deployment without breaking changes

### **Out of Scope**
- Generic dtype support (future enhancement)
- GPU acceleration (future enhancement)
- Non-manifold mesh support

### **Dependencies**
- nalgebra for linear algebra
- parry3d for collision detection
- rayon for parallelization
- geo for 2D operations

### **Timeline**
- **Phase 1**: Foundation & Documentation (1 sprint)
- **Phase 2**: Core Architecture Fix (2 sprints)
- **Phase 3**: API Parity Implementation (3 sprints)
- **Phase 4**: Validation & Testing (1 sprint)

### **Risk Assessment**
- **High**: CSG algorithm complexity may require significant refactoring
- **Medium**: Performance targets may require optimization iterations
- **Low**: API compatibility should be straightforward to maintain
